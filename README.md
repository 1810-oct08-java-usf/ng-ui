# Revature Project Manager (RPM) 
This is the Angular front-end of a full-stack application with the purpose of providing trainers the functionality to submit Revature project 2 information. Project 2 information can be displayed in a master list of projects, edited, and eventually deployed in a future sprint.

## Installation Instructions
* Using some version of a terminal or command prompt, navigate to a directory on your local system where you would like to place this application.
* Utilize `git clone https://github.com/1810-oct08-java-usf/ng-ui/tree/staging` to download the entire repository to your local directory
* To ensure that all application dependencies in package.json are installed, run the command `npm install`
* At this point, you should be able to run `npm start` build and deploy your application to your local server, which will be found at port 4200.
* Your local run will be located at https://localhost:4200

## Usage
* We should include screenshots of our application at this point to illustrate use cases and functionality.

## Testing
We will need to describe how we tested the Angular application.
