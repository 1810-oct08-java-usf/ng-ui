Font:
                  * Body Text
                  * font-family: "futura-pt", arial;
                  * letter-spacing: initial;
                  * font-weight: 400;
                  * Section Headers
                  * font-size: 26px;
                  * text-transform: capitalize;
                  * Bold Headers
                  * font-weight: 600;
                  * text-transform: uppercase;
                  *                   * Logo text
                  * UNKNOWN
                  * Look-alike font:
                  * Termina (Adobe Fonts) (Fort Foundry)
  

                  * This is the font that was ultimately determined to be closest to the official Revature logo text. The most noticeable difference is that some of the Revature logo corners are rounded whereas others are square. In this font, all corners are square. 
                  * Important features of the font which make it most similar: 
                  * Light line weight
                  * Monospaced font (all letters are the same width)
                  * All letters are approximately as wide as they are tall (if not slightly moreso)
                  * The cross-bar of the R and E are (almost) at the same height, whereas the cross-bar for the A is slightly lower


Other:
                     * Use of chevrons in backgrounds 
                     * White Chevrons
